= Hovercard Injection Tool - Bettering twitter.com

Twitter.com now uses "Hovercards" to show user data when you mouse-over a 
@username. With this library, you can load your own custom content into these
hovercards to make them behave any way you like.

== It's Your Event

Injection works by triggering a 'HIT_it' event when the hovercard is loaded, passing 
in the @username for that card. Define your own event; it will be called each
time a hovercard is displayed:

$('.hovercard').bind('HIT_it', function(e, screen_name) {
  //my code
})

== It's Your Data

Your custom event can do anything you would like, but you probably want to
stick some data based on that screen_name into the hovercard. Since jQuery
is preloaded by twitter.com, you can easily overwrite the contents of the 
div that is already injected with the html() function:

  $('.hovercard').bind('HIT_it', function(e, screen_name) {
    $('#HIT').append(
      '<p>rah rah ah ah ah ' + screen_name + ' gah gah ooh la la</p>'
    )
  })

Here is a (crude) way to get some relevant info from a remote server:

  $('.hovercard').bind('HIT_it', function(e, screen_name) {
    $('#HIT').append('<h3>K-Score Dump:</h3><div class="kscore"></div>')
    $('#HIT .kscore').html(
      '<iframe src="http://klout.com/api/twitter/1/klout/[YOUR-USER-KEY-HERE]/' + screen_name + '.js" height="25" width="150"> </iframe>'
    )
  })

If the remote server supports JSONP, you can do away with the iframe. For a 
complete description, see: http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/library/wa-aj-jsonp1/

  
== Use It Your Way

You might want to work this into a greasemonky script or bookmarklet? It is 
probably too long to fit into a straight bookmarklet, so you would need to 
host your js file (that contains HIT combined with your event binding and 
data processing). Once the files is hosted somewhere, you can build your
bookmarklet (see the great instructions at http://betterexplained.com/articles/how-to-make-a-bookmarklet-for-your-web-application/).

The bookmarklet could then be used by navigating to twitter.com and clicking
the bookmarklet once to load in your script. All hovercards will then get your
special treatment.

== Testing

The easiest way to use HIT is to paste it into a browser console. In Firefox
(with Firebug) or a WebKit browser (Safari, Chrome), you can access a command-
line interface that lets you run javascript directly. Pop that open, paste in
the HIT code, and then start experimenting! You can simply re-paste or re-type
your event binding as much as you'd like to keep tweaking it.
